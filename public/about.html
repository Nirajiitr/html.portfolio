<h1>About Me</h1>


<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Niraj Kumar, a 20-year-old currently navigating the exciting journey of B.Tech in Chemical Engineering at IIT Roorkee, now in my second year. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and creativity, with a keen interest in software development, web development, and data science. Academically, I am delving into the complexities of chemical engineering, but beyond the classroom, my heart beats for the world of programming and its endless possibilities.</p>

<h2>Technology Enthusiast:</h2>
<p>In the realm of technology, I've dipped my toes into the languages of C++ and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), eager to explore the intricacies they offer. The world of web development has also captivated me, and I've honed my skills in HTML and CSS to craft digital landscapes. Constantly seeking to broaden my horizons, I approach every coding challenge as an opportunity to learn, grow, and refine my craft. </p>

<h2>Beyond the Screen:</h2>
<p>Away from the screen, I find solace in the pages of books, the refreshing waters of a swimming pool, and the spiritual embrace of worshipping Lord Krishna. The blend of my academic pursuits and personal interests creates a dynamic and holistic approach to life. I believe in the power of hard work, the joy of acquiring new knowledge, and the harmonious balance between the tech-driven present and the rich traditions that shape my worldview.</p>
